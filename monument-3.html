                    Sigiriya:<br>
                    Location: Sigiriya is located in Matale District, Central Province, Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka, an island nation in South Asia, is known for its ancient civilizations, lush landscapes, diverse culture, and rich heritage of architecture and art.
                    <br> Historical background: Sigiriya, also known as the Lion Rock, was built in the 5th century CE by King Kashyapa as a fortified royal palace and citadel. The site is a UNESCO World Heritage site and is considered one of Sri Lanka’s most important historical landmarks. The location was chosen for strategic defense, as the massive rock rises 200 meters above the surrounding plains, providing natural protection and a commanding view of the kingdom.

                    Architecture: Sigiriya combines urban planning, hydraulic engineering, and artistic design. The site has palaces, terraces, gardens, pools, and water systems skillfully integrated into the natural rock formation. The site is named after its most famous architectural feature, which is the Lion Gate, with giant lion paws carved into the rock. Frescoes of heavenly maidens (Sigiriya Damsels) and mirror walls showcase exceptional artistic and engineering skill from the 5th century.
                    <br> Culture: Sigiriya reflects Sri Lankan royal culture, art, and innovation during the Anuradhapura period. The gardens, frescoes, and inscriptions blend to form a spiritual, artistic, and practical life. Today, Sigiriya is a symbol of Sri Lankan heritage, tourism, and national pride, attracting historians, architects, and travelers worldwide.
